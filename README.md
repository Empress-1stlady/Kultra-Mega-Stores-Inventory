###Project Overview
This project aims to provide insights into issues bordering on gender inequality in a manufacturing company. By analysing various aspects of the gender related issues such as gender distribution, gender pay gap, promotion and leadership across departments and regions. I seek to identify trends in hiring and promotion, make data driven recommendations and gain a deeper understanding of equity promotion and inclusivity in the workplace.
